# API Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the API for a fullstack application that employs AI agents to streamline the code development process through a structured workflow. The API facilitates user requirement analysis, backend processing, frontend task execution, and integration validation, ensuring a comprehensive development lifecycle.

## User Stories

### US-1: Requirement Analysis
- **As a**: Developer
- **I want**: to analyze user requirements
- **So that**: I can ensure the application meets user needs effectively.

### US-2: Backend Task Execution
- **As a**: Backend Engineer
- **I want**: to perform backend tasks
- **So that**: I can process data accurately and efficiently.

### US-3: Frontend Task Execution
- **As a**: Frontend Developer
- **I want**: to implement frontend tasks
- **So that**: I can provide a user-friendly interface.

### US-4: Integration Validation
- **As a**: QA Engineer
- **I want**: to validate integration points
- **So that**: I can ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User requirements are accurately captured and documented.
- [ ] Backend tasks are executed without errors, and data is processed correctly.
- [ ] Frontend tasks are implemented according to design specifications.
- [ ] Integration validation tests confirm all components function as expected.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Requirement Analysis
- **Description**: The system must analyze user requirements using natural language processing techniques to extract key features and functionalities.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: User input must be provided.

### FR-2: Backend Task Execution
- **Description**: The system must handle data storage, processing, and retrieval through a RESTful API.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Database must be set up and accessible.

### FR-3: Frontend Task Implementation
- **Description**: The system must render a responsive UI based on user requirements and backend responses.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: Backend API must be functional.

### FR-4: Integration Validation
- **Description**: The system must run integration tests to verify that all components communicate and function together correctly.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: All functional components must be implemented.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Response time: < 200 ms for all API requests
- Throughput: 100 requests/sec

### NFR-2: Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 must be implemented for secure access.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control must ensure that users have appropriate permissions.

## Constraints
- The API must comply with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.
- The application must be developed using the selected technology stack (e.g., Node.js, React).

## Out of Scope
- Real-time collaboration features are not included in this phase.
- Mobile application development is excluded from the initial release.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Utilize NLP to gather user requirements from input.
   - Document requirements in a structured format.

2. **Backend Task Execution**
   - Set up a RESTful API endpoint for data handling.
   - Implement data processing logic based on requirements.

3. **Validation of Backend Tasks**
   - Run unit tests to ensure backend functionality.
   - Validate data integrity and error handling.

4. **Frontend Task Execution**
   - Create UI components based on user requirements.
   - Connect frontend components to the backend API.

5. **Validation of Frontend Tasks**
   - Conduct usability testing to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - Verify frontend functionality against design specifications.

6. **Integration Validation**
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure all components work together.
   - Document the results of integration tests.

7. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - Engage users to test the application against their needs.
   - Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments.

8. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for production deployment.
   - Ensure all environment configurations are correctly set up.

9. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
   - Monitor application performance and error logs.
   - Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement.
