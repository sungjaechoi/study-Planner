# Design System

## Overview
This document outlines the design system for a fullstack application using an AI agent-based code writing process. It covers the structured development workflow, including how to analyze user requirements, perform backend and frontend tasks, validate them, and conduct integration validation.

## Architecture

### System Architecture
The system architecture is designed to facilitate seamless interactions between the frontend and backend through a well-defined API. Below is a high-level diagram of the overall system structure.

### Component Structure
Key components of the application and their responsibilities are outlined below. Each component has specific dependencies that must be managed effectively.

| Component     | Responsibility                                           | Dependencies            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| AI Agent      | Analyzes user requirements and generates code           | NLP Library, Code Parser |
| Backend       | Handles data storage, business logic, and API responses | Database, Auth Service    |
| Frontend      | User interface and client-side logic                     | UI Framework, State Management Library |

## Data Model

### Entities
The following data structures represent the key entities in the application:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  // Additional user fields
}

interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
  assignedTo: string; // User ID
}
```

### State Management
State management flows through the application using a central state store. This approach allows components to access and modify shared state seamlessly.

## UI/UX Design

### User Flow
The user flow outlines the interaction steps a user takes within the application. Below are some key actions and their resulting states:

1. User logs in → Redirect to dashboard
2. User creates a new task → Task added to the list and displayed
3. User marks a task as completed → Task state updated and visual feedback provided

### Component Hierarchy
The component hierarchy showcases the structure of the application’s UI components.

```
App
├── Layout
│   ├── Header
│   ├── Sidebar
│   └── Main
│       ├── TaskList
│       │   └── TaskItem
│       └── TaskDetails
└── Modals
    └── TaskModal
```

### Wireframes
Wireframes can be found at the following links:

## API Design

### Endpoints
The following endpoints are defined for the application’s API. Each endpoint includes its method, path, and a brief description.

| Method | Path                | Description                            |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/users          | Retrieve a list of users               |
| POST   | /api/tasks          | Create a new task                      |
| GET    | /api/tasks/:id      | Retrieve task details by ID            |
| PUT    | /api/tasks/:id      | Update task details by ID              |
| DELETE | /api/tasks/:id      | Delete a task by ID                    |

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: AI Agent Integration
- **Context**: The need for an AI agent to analyze user requirements and generate code.
- **Decision**: Integrate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library to facilitate understanding of user input.
- **Consequences**: This allows for dynamic code generation but requires robust error handling and input validation.

### Decision 2: State Management Approach
- **Context**: The need for consistent state across components.
- **Decision**: Use a centralized state management library (e.g., Redux) for predictable state changes.
- **Consequences**: Simplifies state management but introduces boilerplate code.

## Dependencies
The following external libraries, services, or APIs are required for the application.

| Dependency              | Version | Purpose                                    |
|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| Express                 | ^4.17.1 | Web framework for the backend              |
| Mongoose                | ^5.10.9 | MongoDB ORM for database interaction       |
| React                   | ^17.0.2 | Frontend framework for building UI         |
| Redux                   | ^4.1.0  | State management for React applications    |
| Axios                   | ^0.21.1 | Promise-based HTTP client for API calls    |
