# Requirements Guid

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a fullstack development workflow that utilizes an AI agent to automate code generation processes. The workflow consists of nine steps, including user requirements analysis, backend tasks, validation, frontend tasks, integration validation, and finalization. The goal is to ensure a streamlined and efficient development process while maintaining high quality and adherence to user specifications.

## User Stories

### US-1: User Requirements Analysis
- **As a**: Product Owner
- **I want**: to gather and analyze user requirements
- **So that**: I can ensure the development team understands the project goals and user needs.

### US-2: Backend Development
- **As a**: Backend Developer
- **I want**: to implement backend functionalities based on user requirements
- **So that**: the application can handle data processing and business logic effectively.

### US-3: Frontend Development
- **As a**: Frontend Developer
- **I want**: to create user interfaces that align with the backend functionalities
- **So that**: users can interact with the application seamlessly.

### US-4: Integration Validation
- **As a**: QA Engineer
- **I want**: to perform integration validation between frontend and backend
- **So that**: I can ensure the entire application works as intended.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All user requirements are documented and approved.
- [ ] Backend APIs are developed and tested for functionality.
- [ ] Frontend components are implemented and validated against design specifications.
- [ ] Integration tests are performed, and all critical paths work without errors.
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accessible for future reference.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Requirements Analysis
- **Description**: The AI agent must analyze user requirements gathered through stakeholder interviews and surveys.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: User input must be collected and documented.

### FR-2: Backend Development
- **Description**: Implement backend services, including database interactions and API endpoints.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Completion of user requirements analysis.

### FR-3: Frontend Development
- **Description**: Develop responsive user interfaces using the latest frontend technologies.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Backend services must be available and documented.

### FR-4: Integration Validation
- **Description**: Execute tests to ensure communication between frontend and backend works as intended.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Frontend and backend development must be complete.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- **Response time**: < 200 ms for any API request.
- **Throughput**: Must support up to 1000 requests/sec under peak load.

### NFR-2: Security
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control must be enforced for all sensitive operations.

### NFR-3: Scalability
- The application must be able to scale horizontally to handle increased load without performance degradation.

## Constraints
- The project must comply with GDPR regulations regarding user data handling.
- Limited budget constraints may affect the choice of technology stack.

## Out of Scope
- Integration with third-party services not specified in the user requirements.
- Development of mobile applications for this release.
