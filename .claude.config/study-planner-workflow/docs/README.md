# Structured Development: fullstack

9단계 AI Agent 기반 코드 작성 프로세스 - Please create a workflow that analyzes user requirements, performs backend tasks, validates them, then does frontend tasks, validates those, performs integration validation, and finishes.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

Use the provided installation script:

```bash
# 1. Extract the ZIP file in your project root
unzip structured-development:-fullstack-workflow.zip

# 2. Give execute permission to the script
chmod +x install.sh

# 3. Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Verify .claude directory exists
- ✅ Update settings.local.json with customInstructions
- ✅ Add auto-approval for workflow logs
- ✅ Display installation summary

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

**Step 1:** Copy Files
```bash
cp -r .claude/ ./
cp -r claude.config/ ./
```

**Step 2:** Verify CLAUDE.md
Check that `.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists with the workflow configuration.

**Step 3:** Verify Setup
Check that these files exist:
- `.claude/commands/study-planner-workflow.md`
- `.claude/agents/*.md`
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## 📖 Usage

Run the workflow:

```
/study-planner-workflow <your task description>
```

**Example:**
```
/study-planner-workflow Create a todo list app with database
```

## 🔍 How It Works

This is a **multi-agent workflow system**. When you run the command:

1. Claude Code reads the workflow instructions
2. Uses **Task tool** to call specialist agents
3. Each agent works on their part (architecture, database, frontend, etc.)
4. Results are coordinated and validated
5. Final output is integrated

**Important:** The main Claude Code instance acts as an **orchestrator**, not a developer. It delegates work to specialist agents.

## 📋 Workflow Phases

1. **__implicit_orchestrator__** - Orchestrator that coordinates the Structured Development: fullstack workflow. Worker agents: requirements-analyst, architect, backend-implementer, frontend-implementer, code-reviewer
2. **Requirements Analyst** - Requirements Analyst: 요구사항 분석 및 스펙 문서 작성
3. **Architect** - Architect: 아키텍처 설계 및 설계 문서 작성
4. **Backend Implementer** - Backend Implementer: 백엔드 코드 및 API 구현
5. **Frontend Implementer** - Frontend Implementer: 프론트엔드 코드 및 UI 구현
6. **Code Reviewer** - Code Reviewer: 코드 품질 및 보안 검토

## 📄 Execution Log

All agent executions are logged to:
```
.claude.config/study-planner-workflow/docs/workflow-execution.log
```

View the log to see:
- Which agents ran
- When they started/completed
- Success/failure status

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Claude Code is writing code directly instead of using agents

**Problem:** The workflow is being ignored.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure `.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Try the command again with explicit instruction:
   ```
   /study-planner-workflow <task> (Important: Use Task tool to call agents)
   ```

### Agents are not being called

**Problem:** Task tool is not being invoked.

**Solution:**
- Check that `.claude/CLAUDE.md` contains the workflow instructions
- Make sure you're in a Claude Code session (not regular Claude)
- Try breaking it into steps: "Read /study-planner-workflow and tell me Phase 1"
